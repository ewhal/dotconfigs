2014-11-16 22:03:39	+clsr	I prefer Vim.
2014-11-16 22:04:23	M00SE	Is it because its free?
2014-11-16 22:04:28	+clsr	Emacs is free too.
2014-11-16 22:04:45	Pimster	emacs is freer even
2014-11-16 22:04:54	Pimster	because it's blessed with rms freedom
2014-11-16 22:04:55	+clsr	Incorrect.
2014-11-16 22:05:05	M00SE	Oh, neat.
2014-11-16 22:05:32	Pimster	vim is ugandaware
2014-11-16 22:06:02	+clsr	I'm waiting for neovim.
2014-11-16 22:06:57	+clsr	The reason why Vim is actually more free than emacs is because its license supports conversion to GPL.
2014-11-16 22:07:02	+clsr	So, either Vim license or GPL.
2014-11-16 22:07:24	+clsr	No matter how restrictive Vim license is, the whole is still at least as free as GPL.
2014-11-16 22:07:25	Pimster	wow
2014-11-16 22:07:31	Pimster	WOW
2014-11-16 22:07:37	Pimster	So much ignorance
2014-11-16 22:07:41	+clsr	But, essentially, they're both just as free.
2014-11-16 22:07:52	Pimster	letting users give up freedom is not freer
2014-11-16 22:08:02	+clsr	I did not say Vim is restrictive.
2014-11-16 22:08:04	Pimster	see FSF vs Debian

2014-11-16 22:08:10	+sed	<clsr> I did not say Vim license is restrictive.

Quick question: if I have arrays of items, where first array is holding items [1,2,...,n], second is [n+1,n+2,...,n+k], third is [n+k+1,n+k+2,...,n+k*2] and so on (the last item in n-th array is n*p + n*(n-1)/2*k), how can I find out which array contains a certain item if I have that item?
2014-11-17 02:36:37	@Tadpole	clsr: So your format is [[1,2,3],[4,5,6,7,8],[9],[10,11]] ?

2014-11-17 02:50:49	+psycho	Every array has more T elements, where Tn = x+k, Tk = x+k+p
2014-11-17 02:50:51	+psycho	Right?
2014-11-17 02:51:01	+clsr	x has nothing to do in the formula
2014-11-17 02:51:44	+clsr	p - initial array size; k - element number increment per array; e_n - last element in n-th array (first array is n=1); n - n-th array; x - some element in one of the arrays
2014-11-17 02:51:57	+psycho	So I was kinda wrong
2014-11-17 02:52:21	+clsr	For example, if p=3, k=2, the arrays are [1,2,3], [4,5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12,13,14,15], [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24], ...
2014-11-17 02:52:40	+clsr	And if x=12, I want to get e_n=15 (or n=3)
2014-11-17 02:53:17	+clsr	I've already worked out the formula for e_n if you have the n
2014-11-17 02:55:10	+clsr	15 = n*3 + n*(n-1)/2*2 = n*3 + n*(n-1)
2014-11-17 02:55:47	+clsr	= n * (n + 2)
2014-11-17 02:56:15	+clsr	n^2 + 2*n - 15 = 0
2014-11-17 02:56:43	+clsr	-5 is invalid since negative, therefore n=3
2014-11-17 02:56:54	+clsr	Hm...
2014-11-17 03:00:53	+clsr	k*n^2 + (2*p - k)*n - 2*e_n = 0
