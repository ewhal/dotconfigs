2014-11-16 22:14:39	ewhal4	So I switched over to Weechat just then
2014-11-16 22:18:49	ewhal4	It was pretty easy to switch over to
2014-11-16 23:05:46	~sudden	it looks better and is easier to use
2014-11-16 23:06:03	~sudden	I read some of their source and I dislike how they do things so I'll stick to irssi
2014-11-16 23:06:58	ewhal4	I really like it over Hexchat

2014-11-16 23:10:48	ewhal4	I quite like the plugins for weechat
2014-11-16 23:16:41	monkey	having a nicklist is certainly useful

2014-11-16 23:20:50	~sudden	eww, branded quit message
2014-11-16 23:21:14	analys	It's often the default.
2014-11-16 23:21:22	analys	(unless you mean it can't be changed)
2014-11-16 23:21:25	analys	most clients do it
2014-11-16 23:21:45	ewhal4	I disable join and quit messages
2014-11-16 23:21:57	~sudden	of course
2014-11-16 23:22:45	~sudden	analys: did you try to see if "*Serv*" nicks was blocked for normal clients?
2014-11-16 23:22:51	~sudden	*were
2014-11-16 23:29:59	analys	I did
2014-11-16 23:30:10	analys	Though my intention was *Serv, not *Serv*
2014-11-16 23:38:36	ewhal4	:q
2014-11-16 23:39:11	ewhal4	lol
2014-11-16 23:56:54	~sudden	ok
2014-11-16 23:57:03	~sudden	my though process went:
2014-11-16 23:58:11	~sudden	if you were to try *Serv first and have it succeed you know it checks it and it can be possible for it to be catched by *Serv*
2014-11-16 23:58:16	~sudden	so you only need to check one time
2014-11-16 23:58:22	~sudden	because it's a catch all situation
2014-11-16 23:58:31	~sudden	if you tested *Serv* first
2014-11-16 23:58:53	~sudden	you'd need to test *Serv to know if there actually was something that did it
2014-11-16 23:59:09	~sudden	so the first example just shows you're on your way to an answer instantly
2014-11-16 23:59:36	~sudden	while the other has a possibility of you trying two times before you'll have it confirmed for you that there actually is a block for certain nicks
2014-11-16 23:59:47	~sudden	so --
2014-11-17 00:00:08	~sudden	I thought it'd be more likely to try *Serv*
2014-11-17 00:00:18	~sudden	in your case
2014-11-17 00:10:42	analys	Well, I dismissed the possibility as it would be silly.
2014-11-17 00:10:59	analys	to disallow *serv*
2014-11-17 00:12:02	~sudden	that is a good point

2014-11-17 00:54:25	~sudden	ever since I sent that consciousness video to cai
2014-11-17 00:54:40	~sudden	I've been thinking a lot about ...
2014-11-17 00:54:43	~sudden	what is
2014-11-17 00:56:44	~sudden	I don't know what category I should place these thoughts in
2014-11-17 00:57:04	analys	"Pending Categorisation"
2014-11-17 00:57:20	~sudden	probably close to buffhism or taoism
2014-11-17 00:57:28	~sudden	I don't know much about them
2014-11-17 00:57:56	~sudden	I've come to the conclusion that everything just is
2014-11-17 00:58:04	~sudden	and that's how it is
2014-11-17 00:58:37	~sudden	self-referencial and there's nothing in the whole universe that can do anything about what already is and what is ever going to be
2014-11-17 00:58:58	~sudden	not nessecarily deterministic
2014-11-17 00:59:14	~sudden	I've eliminated time out of the equation
2014-11-17 00:59:16	~sudden	ignoring it
2014-11-17 00:59:28	~sudden	and it doesn't matter if time exists
2014-11-17 00:59:38	~sudden	everything still is
2014-11-17 01:00:53	~sudden	(I've got to be clear that I don't suddenly stop believing in time, time as a messurement is useful. whether it's real or not doesn't matter)
2014-11-17 01:01:05	~sudden	*grammar/spelling
2014-11-17 01:01:19	~sudden	*didn't
2014-11-17 01:02:11	analys	The thing is though, if all actions are fixed, then this sort of reflection seems unlikely.
2014-11-17 01:02:55	~sudden	elaborate?
2014-11-17 01:04:18	analys	Well, the arbitrariness of e.g. switching between reflecting on this and ignoring it/thinking about other things, seems unlikely to be fixed.
2014-11-17 01:04:47	analys	I mean there's no way to say definitively that it isn't, but it just seems unlikely.
2014-11-17 01:06:41	~sudden	before this I thought everything was deterministic. all actions. I didn't care because I didn't know what was going to happen next. it didn't matter if everything were deterministic or not.
2014-11-17 01:06:55	~sudden	what I said now is not the same
2014-11-17 01:06:59	~sudden	it sounds like it is
2014-11-17 01:08:37	~sudden	what I "learned" from this is that I should stop running ahead of myself

2014-11-17 02:52:16	~sudden	I'm pleased with this

2014-11-17 02:55:23	~sudden	when I start the bot
2014-11-17 02:55:30	~sudden	it creates a container of things

2014-11-17 02:56:29	~sudden	that object gets passed to plugins
2014-11-17 02:56:46	~sudden	and it's not changable in anyway
2014-11-17 02:57:03	~sudden	becasue the core/hard/soft reloading functionaity isn't separated yet
2014-11-17 02:57:06	~sudden	when it is
2014-11-17 02:57:16	~sudden	I can modify plugin parameters and such
2014-11-17 03:02:29	~sudden	the loop structure which needs to be static
2014-11-17 03:02:35	~sudden	is two lines

2014-11-17 03:04:22	~sudden	and that's the whole bot
2014-11-17 03:04:25	~sudden	those two lines
2014-11-17 03:22:51	~sudden	cool, I just added a core_reload functionality while it was running that just reloads the core and not everything
2014-11-17 03:25:22	~sudden	interesting
2014-11-17 03:25:36	~sudden	I found a bug in the standard library
2014-11-17 03:25:42	~sudden	where globals where used
2014-11-17 03:25:58	~sudden	in the urllib.request part more specifically
2014-11-17 03:26:21	~sudden	if I reload that library and try to request something a timeout value disappears
2014-11-17 03:26:26	~sudden	and resets to non float
2014-11-17 03:26:33	~sudden	so it complains about it not being a float
