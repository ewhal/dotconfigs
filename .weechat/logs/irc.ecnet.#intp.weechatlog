2014-11-17 00:39:55	+muffin	Kiiwinki: just retroactively apply appropriate amounts of tequila and lemon
2014-11-17 00:40:36	+Kiiwinki	I've never actually drunk tequila
2014-11-17 00:41:10	+Kiiwinki	I tend to buy whatever has the cheapest alcohol
2014-11-17 00:41:33	+Kiiwinki	Really should set up a water/sugar/yeast brew
2014-11-17 00:42:05	+Kiiwinki	Previously my drinking has gotten a little out of hand with the sudden appearance of 20 litres of alcohol
2014-11-17 00:42:16	+Kiiwinki	at 15% or thereabouts
2014-11-17 00:44:57	+muffin	as a student i've usually found spiking orange juice with rubbing alcohol to be the cheapest option
2014-11-17 00:45:15	+Kiiwinki	Rubbing alcohol as in IPA?
2014-11-17 00:47:04	+Kiiwinki	Pretty sure rubbing alcohol is toxic to drink
2014-11-17 00:47:23	+Kiiwinki	btw, what's the price of the cheapest available vodka in your area?
2014-11-17 00:47:39	+muffin	probably a bad translation, what they call rubbing alcohol here is ethanol + water and you can buy it at drug stores
2014-11-17 00:47:42	 *	sudden 
2014-11-17 00:47:49	+Kiiwinki	Around here it's about 13.5 euros for 0.5l of 38% vodka
2014-11-17 00:48:14	+muffin	i think it's 70/30 ratio of ethanol/water
2014-11-17 00:48:55	+Kiiwinki	In Finland, alcohol is not available except in government run monopoly stores
2014-11-17 00:48:58	+muffin	here you can get vodka in half that price
2014-11-17 00:49:04	+Kiiwinki	excluding denatured alcohol
2014-11-17 00:49:07	+muffin	but not quality vodka, just some shitty local ones
2014-11-17 00:49:38	+Kiiwinki	Personally, I don't care about the taste of alcohol
2014-11-17 00:49:51	+Kiiwinki	Except for maybe the bottom bumwines 
2014-11-17 00:50:22	+Kiiwinki	Check this out http://www.viinikartta.fi/media/item_images/alko/DNK/hr/327037.jpg
2014-11-17 00:50:29	+Kiiwinki	Even the label screams "avoid this shit"
2014-11-17 00:50:31	+muffin	i didn't either, when i was drinking gallons of it
2014-11-17 00:50:37	+muffin	lol
2014-11-17 00:51:25	+Kiiwinki	("avoid this shit" is not written on it. I was describing the overall appearance of the label)
2014-11-17 00:51:41	+muffin	i got that part
2014-11-17 00:52:05	+Kiiwinki	Just making sure
2014-11-17 00:53:01	+muffin	buying alcohol only at stores owned by the government pretty much sucks
2014-11-17 00:53:13	+muffin	i think it would be enough for me to change my country of residence
2014-11-17 00:53:39	+muffin	i mean, does this even goes for low volume stuff like beer?
2014-11-17 00:54:47	+Kiiwinki	No
2014-11-17 00:55:10	+Kiiwinki	Anything at or below 4.7% is available at grocery stores
2014-11-17 00:59:49	+muffin	that's comforting, i guess
2014-11-17 01:00:19	+Kiiwinki	Not if you don't like beer, which I don't
2014-11-17 01:01:02	+Kiiwinki	*Yes, if you like beer - which I don't

2014-11-17 05:59:20	+Kiiwinki	For the past few days, I've been watching this documentary series, "Begin Japanology" (available on youtube)
2014-11-17 05:59:49	+Kiiwinki	Both the narrator and presenter make use of the annoying intrusive "R"
2014-11-17 06:00:19	+Kiiwinki	For example, the word "saw" is pronounced "sawr" when it is followed by a vowel

2014-11-17 06:12:44	+snacky	Kiiwinki: is that an american accent, or a british one?
2014-11-17 06:12:56	+snacky	a small percentage of northeasterners do that
2014-11-17 06:14:27	+Kiiwinki	Seems to be a british thing
2014-11-17 06:14:44	+Kiiwinki	Although it could be present in the us as well
2014-11-17 06:14:55	+Kiiwinki	Not sure why I've only recently started noticing it
2014-11-17 06:16:36	+Tolf	Kiiwinki sounds like a familiar name
2014-11-17 06:17:33	+Tolf	I was also watching that japanology show
2014-11-17 06:20:04	+Kiiwinki	Interesting stuff in the series
2014-11-17 06:20:19	+Kiiwinki	Will probably head over to the asian and japanese grocery stores next week
2014-11-17 06:20:56	+Kiiwinki	Will try to find some dashi ingredients
2014-11-17 06:21:20	+Tolf	I watched the one on wasabi and women's nylons
2014-11-17 06:21:28	+Kiiwinki	I suspect making dashi from scratch would be too expensive
2014-11-17 06:21:34	+Tolf	And miniatures
2014-11-17 06:21:36	+Kiiwinki	They probably have insta-dashi of some sort
